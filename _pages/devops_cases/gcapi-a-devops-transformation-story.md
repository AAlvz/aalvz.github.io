GCAPI. A DevOps transformation Story Pt. 1
===

...almost 1 year ago, when I first joined. I heard this:

  _"Hey, tell the other part of the team to check the PR"_

Why is this sentence full of bad signs?

  1. First of all, it clearly shows that we were not behaving as a team.
  2. We were clearly not able to communicate transparently between us.
  3. We were splitted in the tasks that we were doing, and we were not caring at all about what the "other part of the team" was doing. 
  4. 

This was known as the project that most DevOps broke/rotated.
Why?

OK. This was happening:

|    Task     | Besct Case Scenario  | Worst Case Scenario |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Create new Dev Environment | 4 hours | 5 days |
| Production deployments | 4 features/ 2 weeks | 5 days |


Why was this happening? 

    - Duplicated Scripts
    - Gaps in communication
    - Not well identified process

_True stroy_

We managed to improve a lot. Now we say things like:

_This is the best team in the company_
_I want to hep in other areas_

and my personal favourite:

_Nothing is breaking now_

(Actually the last is not true because when nothing breaks, everyone is silent)
