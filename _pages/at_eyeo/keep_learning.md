So the 3rd day at the office is over and a lot keeps happening, but the important part is that Paco and I are starting to understand how everything works over there... and KÃ¶ln?!  Well.. to be honest we don't know... A lot of work, and a lot of things to get used to. So far we've only met our way to work and back. But the day to go around Cologne will come... Oh! and we also need to open bank accounts overe here aaaand... get a new WG (A new flat...). So yes. As we discussed with Job today: "First things first". 

He work a lot with Matze... He's the devOps @EyeO and now we are too. =) ... He's crazy and talks really fast.. like trying to express the speed of his thoughts. Yes, he knows a lot and he's great beacause (apparelty) he likes to teach also. He has no problem explaining and going faster and faster... I mean, slower when you need to.. haha.. 

It's obvious that he has a lot of knoledge of how to use [GitHub](www.github.com) in the correct way. 
Today he touched some important points:

* **Short commits** are important!

* **Branching is painless** so do it a lot. 

* Dive into [**Git - rebase**](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase)
  * So as far as I undertand, it is usefull whe you go back in versions and you need to commit from there creating a new commit in front of the master and then merging master with your new commit. 
  * [More visual link](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing)
    * This way changes are more readable also. 

* Want to merge commits? That's also a use for rebasing, so know the [**Squash**](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) term. 
  * Basically is merging commits when they are very related. 
    * [Here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5189560/squash-my-last-x-commits-together-using-git) are a lot of examples to use it.
    * Remember that for example using `git reset --hard HEAD~3` will get you 3 commits back in time. 
    
* [**Git stash**](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash) is usefull when you have a *Current working state*. It's like making a label so you can go back to this at anytime after you're done with experiments. 

* **Make a branch for every related topic**
  * This way you avoid mixing different stuff and changes on what you do, and the advance can be seen easily. 
    * As we said before, branching cost you nothing, so it's good to make it a lot. That's why it was made for: 
      1. New Topic
      2. New Branch
      3. Short commits
      4. Great Push :) 
      
      
* Mercurial sucks... (I like it still though.. need to get deeper into it.. but come on.. he's the expert here... )
      
Then, so far so good... Let's see what will come...
