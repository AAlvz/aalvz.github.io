Indeed: It flys by... And probably the internship will too. 

The adaptation to the office is easier every day. What helps? **The culture** of course:

1. The people.
   - When the environment that surrounds you makes you feel like you are between friends, everything is easier. You can be yourself more and more each day. 
    - 4.20. Yes. At that time everyone in the office meets in the ping pong room and each game is great. I still can't win. But soon. This helps **breaking the ice** which of course is imporntant. And teaches you to be afriaid of Viky, Tim and The Professor. He shoots to kill.
    - Burger Friday. This took me by surprice and I'm thankfull that this exists. 
    - Even when everybody speaks different languages. *You know that you can talk to everybody.*
2. The trust. 
    - When you've got the **freedom to manage your own time** somehow you get more responsible. Everyone knows what they are supposed to do and they've got the **freedom of choice.** Of course after talking with Felix and Wladimir if it's about IT.
    - This last thing could be a danger in the wrong hands. 
3. The transparency
   - You can go almost to every office, and see what is going on with everybody else. 
    - Everything is Open Source and you can always [contribute](https://adblockplus.org/en/contribute-code)

Having a good communication is escential to any kind of work. You need to be sure that you got the plan before applying it. 

BTW Here are more **Git essentials** of this week!

`git rm` 

`git mv` 

This 2 commants are really important to keep track of your files whenever you remove them or change their names. Instead of using the normal rm and mv commands, using the ones with git help to the tracking and the explanation of the growth of the system. 

The first week is basically to warm up.. so the cools stuff is just beginning... 

// Have you ever seen how a .deb package works? Unpackit and check it out. It's quite fun.  

// We still don't have a house for the time after the next week... Hopefully we'll find something soon....
