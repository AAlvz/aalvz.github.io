Today was the first day.
I've never used English this much on one day. It is a little bit tired if you are not used to it... But apparently you do after a while...
Nervous? Of course. More excited I'd say... We arrived just in time (Germans...) And met Till. CEO. He's very nice. They all are! After him, Nadja. Till gave us a quick tour through the 7th and the 8th where everybody is. Matze ended the quick tour with us. He's the new devop and guess what? He told us that all the work we've been doing won't be used... Hmm.. There's a lot to do anyway. About the team? Lots of names! But they are great at ping pong... Job and Vicki .. They are good at it and apparently she comes and goes into eyeo all the time.
Christian (my new tshirt rival) helped us with our new hw (new monitors and all for us! :D) and office which is next to the most awesome office at eyeO haha... That's Jobs and Manuels office.. Sebastian too I think..
Mondays is the weekly meeting so they introduced us there with everybody.
Of course Felix and Wladimir were there. I imagined them somewhat different but they are not bad. Jk. They were pretty friendly with us also. Oh right! We've got presents and everything. The office key, a public transport card, shirt, stickers and more.
It felt to me that it was a lot of info though we didn't code a single line today... We saw Matze doing that. That counts? I'm kinda tired though...
Maybe later this post will be made more beautiful
.. Tomorrow we continue with the node classifier stuff...
We stayed until 7 today... Wow.. Anyway, what to know for the first day?

  - Ask what you don't know. Everyone are so nice.
  - Enjoy your office view.. It's awesome.. The balcony also.
  - Practice ping pong before you arrive.
  - Be prepared for quick talking.
  - Be yourself!
