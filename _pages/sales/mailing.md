How do you close a great prospect?
Here are some tips to do so. (Which can be applied on dating)

(At the end the questions that motivated this post)

Step 0. Get the prospect, be creative.
Look what I built! Can you look at it and tell me what to improve?
Personalize!

asking for feecback as apitch


Step 1. Lower Entry Barriers.

Objective: To get the prospect to the question? "Shall we work with them?"
To avoid: "Can you send me your value proposal? Your pricing? Your CVs?... Avoid questions"
Provide everything that the prospect needs to don't have any doubt or concern.
Be transparent about pricing, send NDAs,
If they stuck in the pricing, negotiate

Step 2. Establish Trust
Make them feel comfortable. 
Let them see you're an actual person. One on one meetings.
Use references. You've worked with "this and that" company and it has worked

Step 3. Follow Up.
It´s all about taste. 1 mail per week is fine. Taste about being pushy?  Meh.. 
Happen to be in the Neighbourhood

Step 4. Make urgecy. FOMO
"I have more people asking for my services, so I´d need an answer in two weeks
since we are small and we have to be very selective about the companies we 
work with"

Step 5. You won't close all. Worry about other stuff. 
Dont worry about pipeline.
The risk of everthing working out (Closing them all) is pretty low.
And even if you do close them all.. it's a good problem.
Worry about the things that matter to worry about


FOMO. Like dating, show how you have more options and there would be no problem if
they say NO.
