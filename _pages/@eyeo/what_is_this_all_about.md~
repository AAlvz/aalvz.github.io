What is coolest than having a record of all what you'll be doing and learn in your internship?? ... I can't think about something either...

This is me: ![Me](https://en.gravatar.com/userimage/44260813/dcf33efd4cf14a3061bee4d606cb84a2.jpg)
And I'm loving Markdown to make posts....

What will you find in here?

* DevOps stuff mainly. Hopefully.
* The process we've been trought to get in here.
* Stuff from Germany.
* More random stuff about myself.
* Travel tips maybe... And geek stuff surely

To begin here is my [GitHub](https://github.com/aalvz)

On monday we begin at [EyeO](http://eyeo.com) as technologies interns mainly ('til now) in the infrastructure part.

This Blog will be up some hours a day... I don't want to lose all my money in hosting yet.. haha.. Once I get used to â‚¬, you'll see this blog up more and more.... Stay tunned...
